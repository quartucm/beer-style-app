#Beer Style App
This is a simple app built using React, Redux and Node. I built this to get a better understanding of React + Redux and it has given me that. Based on this boilerplate: https://github.com/werein/react

Here is a live demo:
https://beer-style-app.herokuapp.com/

To Run Front End:

    npm start 

To Run Back End Server:

    npm run server

To get your local backend to work, you will need to 

 - Generate an API key on http://brewerydb.com 
 - Add your API key to server/local.config.sample.js
 - Rename local.config.sample.js to local.config.js

Full warning: This is a Proof of Concept and is by no means ready for production.

To do:
 - Go through linter
 - Universal rendering
